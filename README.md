docker compose build
docker compose up -d

## Todo:

- Adding Team names instead of just ids. Looks whack in FE
- Pagination in endpoints and frontend tables.
- User setup. Just user and admin roles to start.
- Authentication using AUth0
- Deploy somewhere. Don't know where but would be cool to do.
